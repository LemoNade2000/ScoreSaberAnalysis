# ScoreSaberAnalysis
Using ScoreSaber API, it copies all ranked scores of desired group of players.

I used TenteEEEE's ranked song list for scraping data for existing ranked songs. You can check out his spreadsheet and source codes at https://github.com/TenteEEEE/S3Sampler.

The main purpose of this tool is to gather the data necessary to perform whatever you want to do with ranked song data: maybe for your simple curiosity, or do some fancy magic with it so fellow beat saber players can ponder upon it. Whatever it may be, the game has too much data to be thrown away.

Existing data was last gathered on 16/07/21 as JSON(everything except the ranked scores) and CSV format, and scores were gathered throughout the span of two days from that day, so I can't say the scores are all on the same page, but I couldn't figure out a way to cache all data at same exact moment with the ratelimit API currently has. 

If you have any suggestions or questions, I'm open to anything within my capability.

You can perform simple two map correlation test now.
